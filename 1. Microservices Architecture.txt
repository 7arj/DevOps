1. Microservices Architecture:
Breaking down monolithic applications into smaller, independent services
Services communicate via APIs
2. Components of Microservices:
DNS (Domain Name System)
Load Balancers
Authentication and Authorization
API Gateway
Databases (SQL, NoSQL, Redis)
Message Brokers (e.g., Kafka)
3. Communication Types:
Synchronous communication
Asynchronous communication (Publish-Subscribe model, Queue model)
4. Key Concepts:
Service Discovery
Event Syncing
Externalized Logging
Stateless Services
5. 12-Factor App:
Codebase
Dependencies
Config
Build, release, run
Processes
Port binding
Concurrency
Disposability
Dev/prod parity
Logs
Admin processes
6. Tools Mentioned:
ELK Stack
Splunk
Dynatrace
Datadog
7. Best Practices:
Separate codebase for each microservice
Externalize configurations
Implement CI/CD for each service
Design services to be stateless
Externalize logs
