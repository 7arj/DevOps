Docker Networking Notes

1. Introduction
   - Allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.
   - Crucial for troubleshooting and system design.

2. Basic Concepts
   - IP Address: Unique address for devices (IP protocol).
   - Ethernet Card/Cable: Hardware for connection.
   - Switch: Connects devices, forwards data.
   - Gateway: Connects different networks.
   - Subnetting:
     - Dividing networks into subnetworks.
     - CIDR notation (e.g., /24, /26).

3. Docker Network Architecture
   - Docker creates a virtual network on the host.
   - docker0: Default bridge network created on install.
   - Containers connect to docker0 via veth (virtual ethernet) pairs.

4. Network Types
   - Bridge: Default. Containers on same host communicate.
   - Host: Uses host's network stack directly (no isolation).
   - None: No network access (isolated).
   - Custom Bridge: User-defined for specific isolation.

5. Container Networking
   - Each container gets its own network namespace & IP.
   - Communication via IP addresses.
   - Docker uses iptables for NAT/routing.

6. Commands
   - Create network:
     $ docker network create my_net
   - Inspect network:
     $ docker network inspect my_net
   - Connect to network:
     $ docker network connect my_net my_container

7. Multiple Networks
   - Containers can connect to multiple networks.
   - Useful for accessing isolated services.

8. Troubleshooting
   - Tools: docker network inspect, ip addr, ping.
   - Check connectivity between containers.

9. Security
   - Use network isolation to prevent unauthorized communication.
