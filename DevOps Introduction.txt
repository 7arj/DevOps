DevOps Introduction

1. DevOps Overview
   - DevOps combines software development and IT operations.
   - Aims to deliver applications and services faster and more reliably.
   - Involves practices, cultural philosophies, and tools.

2. AWS and Cloud Infrastructure
   - AWS has different regions (e.g., Mumbai, Hyderabad).
   - Regions contain multiple data centers/buildings for redundancy.
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides isolated network environments.
   - Subnets can be public (connected to internet gateway) or private.

3. Microservices Architecture
   - Requests typically go through a load balancer and authentication/authorization service.
   - Microservices can communicate synchronously or asynchronously.
   - Asynchronous communication can use queue or publish-subscribe models.

4. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
   - Comparison: Traditional Waterfall model vs. DevOps approach.
   - Waterfall: Requirements > Design > Coding > Testing > Release > Maintenance.
   - DevOps emphasizes continuous integration and delivery.

5. Shift Left Approach
   - Catch bugs and issues as early as possible in the development process.
   - Reduces cost and the impact of fixing issues.

6. Security Testing
   - Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Checks for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes code for security issues.
   - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Tests running applications.

7. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
   - Clone code repository.
   - Install dependencies.
   - Lint code.
   - Compile/build code.
   - Run unit tests.
   - Perform SCA and SAST.
   - Create Docker image.
   - Push artifact to repository (e.g., JFrog Artifactory).

8. DevOps Tools
   - Version Control: Git, GitHub.
   - CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
   - Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes.
   - Infrastructure as Code: Terraform.

9. Project Expectations
   - Implement a CI pipeline for an existing or new project.
   - Understand and explain each step in the pipeline.
   - Can use existing code samples but must comprehend the process.
