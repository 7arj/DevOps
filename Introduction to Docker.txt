Introduction to Docker

1. Advantages of Docker
   - Allows creation of separate containers for different applications
   - Solves dependency conflicts (e.g., Python 2.7 vs 3.0)
   - Reduces environment setup time significantly

2. Docker vs Virtual Machines
   - Docker doesn't use its own operating system
   - Docker interacts directly with the Linux kernel
   - Docker works on Windows and Mac using hypervisor technology (WSL for Windows, hypervisor for Mac)

3. Linux Kernel and Docker
   - Linux kernel integrates with various hardware
   - Docker containers interact directly with the kernel, not with distribution-specific software

4. Docker Image Layers
   - Images are defined as layered file systems
   - Each layer represents a step in the image creation process
   - Layers are stored in the overlay2 folder by default

5. Docker Commands
   - docker run: Creates and starts a container
   - docker ps: Lists running containers
   - docker ps -a: Lists all containers (including stopped ones)
   - docker stop: Stops a running container
   - docker kill: Forcefully stops a container
   - docker container prune: Removes all stopped containers
   - docker images: Lists all images
   - docker rmi: Removes an image
   - docker pull: Downloads an image from Docker Hub
   - docker commit: Creates a new image from a container
   - docker push: Pushes an image to Docker Hub
   - docker inspect: Provides detailed information about a container or image

6. Docker Hub
   - Repository for storing and sharing Docker images
   - Requires account creation and login for pushing images

7. Docker Internals
   - Default root directory: /var/lib/docker
   - Storage driver: overlay2 (default)
   - Image layers are stored in the overlay2 folder

8. Image Creation and Pushing
   - Creating an image from a container using docker commit
   - Pushing images to Docker Hub
   - Image naming conventions for pushing to Docker Hub

9. Docker Image Layers (Additional Details)
   - Images consist of multiple layers
   - Layers are reused when creating similar images to save space
   - Layer dependencies affect how images are built and tagged

10. Container vs Image
    - Containers are running instances of images
    - Changes made in a container don't affect the original image
    - New images can be created from modified containers
