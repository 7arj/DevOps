A Simple CI using GitHub Actions

1. Introduction
   - GitHub Actions: CI/CD platform built directly into GitHub.
   - Automates workflows (Build, Test, Deploy) when events happen (e.g., Push, Pull Request).

2. Setup for Java Project
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in repo.
   - Add a YAML file (e.g., `maven.yml`).

3. YAML Structure Components
   - Name: Display name of the workflow.
   - On (Triggers): When to run.
     - `push`: Run on every push.
     - `pull_request`: Run when PR is opened.
   - Jobs: Group of steps. Run in parallel by default.
   - Steps: Individual tasks (commands or actions).

4. Actions vs Run Commands
   - `uses`: Uses a pre-built Action (reusable code).
     - `actions/checkout@v3`: Clones the repo.
     - `actions/setup-java@v3`: Installs Java/JDK.
   - `run`: Executes a shell command.
     - `run: mvn -B package`

5. Example Workflow (Java/Maven)
   name: Java CI with Maven

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main" ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Set up JDK 17
         uses: actions/setup-java@v3
         with:
           java-version: '17'
           distribution: 'temurin'
           
       - name: Build with Maven
         run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml

6. Debugging & Logs
   - Go to "Actions" tab in GitHub repo.
   - Click on the workflow run.
   - Click on the job ("build") to see logs for every step.
   - If build fails (Red X), check the `Build with Maven` step logs for errors.

7. Notes
   - Configuration is declarative (YAML).
   - "Distribution" in setup-java is important (temurin, zulu, adopt).
