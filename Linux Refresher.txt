Linux Refresher Notes

1. CI/CD Review
----------------
CI (Continuous Integration):
- Process: Code Check-in -> Pipeline Trigger -> Lint -> Build -> Unit Test -> SCA -> SAST -> Dockerize -> Push Artifact.
- Tools often used: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
- Key Goal: Catch integration issues early.

CD (Continuous Delivery vs Deployment):
- Starts after CI.
- Stages: Deploy to SIT (System Integration Testing) -> SIT Automated Tests -> Deploy to Performance Env -> DAST (Security).
- Continuous Delivery: Requires manual approval before Production.
- Continuous Deployment: Fully automated to Production.

2. Linux Introduction
----------------------
- Overview: Open-source OS, created by Linus Torvalds (1991).
- Usage: Runs >90% of production servers.
- Distros: Ubuntu, Red Hat (RHEL), CentOS, Debian.
- Basic Commands:
  $ uname -a        # Check kernel info
  $ cat /etc/*release # Check distribution info
  $ top             # Check system processes/resources

3. AWS EC2 Instance Creation
-----------------------------
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image): The OS template (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).
- Instance Type: CPU/RAM config (e.g., t2.micro).
- Key Pair: Login credential (.pem file).
- Network: Choose VPC & Subnet.
- IP Types:
  - Public IP: Internet accessible (dynamic).
  - Private IP: Internal only.
  - Elastic IP: Static public IP.
- Security Groups: Firewall rules (Allow SSH port 22).
- Storage: EBS volumes.
- Spot Instances: Bid for unused capacity (cheaper but interruptible).

4. Connecting to EC2 Instance
-----------------------------
- Protocol: SSH (Secure Shell).
- Prerequisite: .pem key file with restricted permissions.
- Default Users: 'ubuntu' (Ubuntu), 'ec2-user' (Amazon Linux/RHEL).

Commands:
# 1. Change permissions of key file (CRITICAL STEP)
$ chmod 600 keyfile.pem

# 2. Connect to instance
$ ssh -i keyfile.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP>

5. AWS Networking Concepts
---------------------------
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Your isolated network in AWS.
- Subnets:
  - Public Subnet: Has Internet Gateway (IGW) attached.
  - Private Subnet: No direct internet access (uses NAT Gateway for outbound).
- VPC Peering: Connecting two different VPCs privately.
