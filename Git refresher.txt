Docker Overview:
- Docker is a platform for creating and managing containers
- Usage of Docker in production is reducing, but it's still the best platform for learning containerization
- Kubernetes now uses ContainerD and Cryo instead of Docker

Containers:
- Containers are lightweight alternatives to virtual machines
- They are always created from images
- Containers do not have their own operating system, they use the host OS

Docker Architecture:
- Docker Client: Interacts with the Docker Daemon
- Docker Daemon: Does all the work (checking for images, downloading, creating containers)
- Docker Hub: Remote repository for Docker images

Key Docker Concepts:
- Images
- Containers
- Volumes
- Networking

Docker Commands:
- docker run: Creates and runs a new container
- docker run -it: Creates an interactive container with terminal access
- docker ps: Lists running containers
- docker images: Lists available images

Container vs Virtual Machine:
- Containers are much lighter than VMs
- VMs have their own OS, while containers share the host OS
- Containers start much faster than VMs

Docker Installation:
- Can be installed on Ubuntu using a convenience script
- Windows and Mac use a hypervisor to run Linux containers

Docker Hub:
- Central repository for Docker images
- Images can be pulled from here if not available locally

Practical Example:
- Created and ran a "hello-world" container
- Created an interactive Ubuntu container

Docker's Interaction with Host OS:
- Docker communicates with the host OS to perform operations
- This is why containers are lightweight and don't need their own OS.
