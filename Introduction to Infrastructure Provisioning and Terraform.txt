Introduction to Infrastructure Provisioning and Terraform

1. DevOps is More Than CI/CD
   - It also covers:
     - Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios).
     - Logging (ELK Stack).
     - Infrastructure Provisioning (IaC).

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Categories
   A. Provisioning Tools: Setup the servers/network (Terraform, CloudFormation).
   B. Config Management: Configure software inside servers (Ansible, Puppet, Chef).
   C. Server Templating: Pre-packaged images (Docker, Vagrant, Packer).

3. Introduction to Terraform
   - Open Source, Platform Agnostic (Works with AWS, Azure, GCP).
   - Declarative: You define "What you want", not "How to do it".
   - State Management: Keeps track of resources in `terraform.tfstate`.

4. Terraform Workflow
   1. Write Code: Create `.tf` files (e.g., `main.tf`).
   2. Init: `$ terraform init` (Downloads provider plugins).
   3. Plan: `$ terraform plan` (Preview changes - Dry run).
   4. Apply: `$ terraform apply` (Create/Update infrastructure).
   5. Destroy: `$ terraform destroy` (Delete everything).

5. Terraform State
   - The "Brain" of Terraform.
   - Compares 3 things:
     1. Your Code (.tf files).
     2. The State File (terraform.tfstate).
     3. Actual Cloud Resources (AWS).
   - If someone deletes an EC2 manually, Terraform detects the drift via state.

6. Best Practices
   - NEVER hardcode secrets (Access Keys). Use Environment Variables or IAM Roles.
   - Always run `plan` before `apply`.
   - Use Version Control (Git) for .tf files.

7. Parallel Execution
   - Terraform builds a dependency graph.
   - If resources (e.g., 2 EC2 instances) don't depend on each other, Terraform creates them in PARALLEL.

8. AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
   - Pre-configured templates for instances (OS + App Server).
   - Used to launch instances quickly.

9. Why Terraform?
   - Consistency & Speed.
   - Repeatable infrastructure (Dev/Stage/Prod environments look identical).
   - Scalable management.
