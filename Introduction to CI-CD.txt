Introduction to CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

1. Evolution of Software Development Models
   - Waterfall: Sequential. Long release cycles.
   - PLP (Predictable Release Model): Structured but rigid.
   - Agile: Iterative. Customer feedback focused.
   - Limitations of old models:
     - Slow feedback loops.
     - "Throwing over the wall" handoffs between Dev & Ops.

2. Introduction to CI/CD
   - CI (Continuous Integration): Automating code integration (Build/Test) frequently.
   - CD (Continuous Delivery): Automating release process up to Production.
   - Continuous Deployment: Fully automated deployment to Production (No manual gate).

3. The CI Pipeline Steps (The "Build" Phase)
   1. Checkout: Pull code from Git.
   2. Linting: Check code style.
   3. SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Check libraries for known vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP).
   4. Build/Package: Compile & create artifact (JAR, WAR).
   5. Unit Tests: Test small functions (Success/Fail).
   6. SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing): Scan source code for security flaws.
   7. Containerize: Build Docker Image.
   8. Scan Image & Push: Scan for OS vulns and push to Registry (JFrog/DockerHub).

4. The CD Pipeline Steps (The "Deploy" Phase)
   1. Deploy to SIT (System Integration Testing).
   2. Run Integration Tests.
   3. Deploy to Staging/Performance Env.
   4. Run Performance/Load Tests.
   5. Deploy to Production.

5. DevOps vs DevSecOps
   - DevOps: Dev + Ops collaboration.
   - DevSecOps: Integrating Security from Day 1 (Shift Left).

6. Types of Testing
   - Unit: Smallest part.
   - Integration: Do modules work together?
   - System: End-to-end.
   - Performance: Load/Stress testing.
   - Security: SAST/DAST/SCA.

7. Advantages of DevOps
   - Faster TTM (Time to Market).
   - Higher Quality (Automated testing).
   - Cost Optimization.
   - Feature Flagging: Toggle features on/off without redeploying.
